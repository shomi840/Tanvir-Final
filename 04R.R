Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global health concern, especially in resource-constrained
countries, such as Bangladesh. This study aimed to identify the factors contributing to antibiotic
misuse by assessing knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP). A cross-sectional study was conducted
from August 20 to August 30, 2022, among 704 parents of school-going children in Dhaka South
City. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the KAP, and multivariate models, including linear
and ordinal logistic regression, were used to explore the associations between these factors. The
findings revealed that approximately 22% of the participants were male and 78% were female. Most
parents (58%) had completed higher secondary education. Approximately 45% of the respondents
         
demonstrated moderate knowledge, 53% had uncertain attitudes, and 64% exhibited antibiotic
 misuse. Factors such as parental age, education level, employment status, income, childâ€™s age,
 and family type significantly influenced KAP. These findings emphasize the importance of targeted
education and awareness initiatives to enhance knowledge and responsible antibiotic use among
 parents, contributing to global efforts against antibiotic resistance. The government should enforce
laws and regulations regarding the misuse of antibiotics.
